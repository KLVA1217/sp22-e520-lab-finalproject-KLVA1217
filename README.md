# Seven Segment Display Counter

The objective of this project is to implement a Seven Segment Display (SSD) Counter on a Zybo Z7010 Development Board. In Vivado the hardware platform will be created and exported as a .xsa file. In Vitis the software application will be developed and built from the hardware platform in order to fully realize the SSD Counter.
